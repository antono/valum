Valum micro-framework
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valum-framework/valum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valum-framework/valum)

Valum is a web micro-framework entirely written in the
[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala) programming language.

Features
--------

Valum is built upon libsoup and provides a minimal set of features that covers
just enough of the HTTP protocol to suit any requirement:

 - router with scope, typed parameters and low-level utilities
 - simple Request-Response mechanism via callback
 - cookies and session handling
 - complete integration of the [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/)
   protocol
 - [CTPL](http://ctpl.tuxfamily.org/), a simple templating engine
 - extensive documentation available at
   [valum.readthedocs.org](http://valum.readthedocs.org/en/latest)

If you need more horsepower, bindings exist for

 - HTTP protocol elements with
   [libsoup](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/libsoup)
 - database abstraction via [GDA](http://www.gnome-db.org/Home)
 - cryptography and password hashing with
   [gcrypt](http://www.gnu.org/software/libgcrypt/)
 - more bindings on
   [GNOME wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/ExternalBindings) and
   [nemequ/vala-extra-vapis](https://github.com/nemequ/vala-extra-vapis)
